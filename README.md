# acropup-UserStyle-CSS-Scripts
This is a compilation of UserStyle CSS scripts for Stylus/Stylish that make websites I use less annoying. Some sites are too distracting or inconvenient to use as provided, and some features are of no interest to me and just take up space and detract from the content. The scripts are utilitarian and are not intended as visual themes or ad-blocking scripts. These are primarily of personal interest in making the internet more pleasant for me to use, but feel free to ask questions or provide additional CSS customizations or feedback and I will consider making changes.

I previously made [custom AdBlock filters][1] for a similar purpose, except that they run on the [uBlock Origin] extension. [Stylus] has proven valuable enough that it is now a full-time extension of mine, so I no longer need to use/abuse uBlock Origin in that way.

These UserStyle scripts have not been tested on anything besides Chrome with the [Stylus extension][Stylus], and the particular websites as they exist today.

See individual files for descriptions of what they do. The easiest way to install a UserStyle with Stylus is to view that script in GitHub and click the Raw button in the top right corner of the viewer. Stylus should recognize it and offer to install the script. For example, here is a direct link to the [raw youtube.user.css][2].
