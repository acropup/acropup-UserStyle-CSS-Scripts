# acropup-UserStyle-CSS-Scripts
UserStyle CSS scripts for Stylus/Stylish that I gone and done to make the internet nicer to me. Many of these CSS customizations simply make the website more comfortable and convenient to use, typically by reducing gratuitous whitespace, moving objects slightly, or hiding unnecessary parts of the page. These are not intended as visual themes or adblock scripts.

These UserStyle scripts have not been tested on anything but Chrome with the [Stylus extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), and the particular websites as they exist today.

See individual files for descriptions of what they do. If anything is broken for you, if you dislike a change I've made, or want to request new modifications, let me know and I will consider it!
