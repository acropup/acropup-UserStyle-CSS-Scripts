[![Add script to Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Add_to_Stylus-youtube.user.css-238b8b.svg)][RawYoutube]<br>

Improves the visibility and style of elements throughout YouTube:
- Many features are customizable through the Stylish Configuration (Gear) menu
- Supports both Light Mode and Dark Mode
- Reduces needless whitespace, allowing up to 4 lines of title text within the same area
- Colour the YouTube logo as a visual indicator that this UserStyle script is enabled (optional)
- Hide Playlists from search results and recommendations

![YtHomeSmall]<br>

- Improves visibility of "Show more" and "Read more" buttons
- Shows more of the video description by default (optional)
- The sentiment bar (showing likes vs dislikes) is made more eye-catching
- Bottom gradient over video isn't as obtrusive when the progress bar appears
- Removes the "More videos" popup over paused videos
- Captions don't move (and further obscure the video) when the progress bar appears
- Hide overlays on video preview thumbnails

![YtWatchSmall]<br>

- The end-of-video "video wall" now shows all video titles by default (optional)
- Reduces visibility of video overlays, such as links to uploader's channel, videos, and playlists (optional)
